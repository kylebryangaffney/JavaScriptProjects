## Overview
This repository contains JavaScript projects created for The Tech Academy JavaScript course. It serves as a central place to store, manage, and track my progress as I build out projects

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to centrally organize all course projects, document progress, and make it easy to review or update past work over time.
